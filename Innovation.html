	Jack then logs into the Advisor Dashboard to take 
	a quick glance of New Alerts, Recent Form Orders 
	and Total Assest. 

	He can see graphs like purchases and redemptions, 
	top clients and other info he typically reviews 
	via his desktop at work.

	Jack remembers he had a recent conversation with Kate
	and goes to the "Clients Panel", selects "Kate"..... 
	and reviews his most recent chats and emails before 
	she arrives.
